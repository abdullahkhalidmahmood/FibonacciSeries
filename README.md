## About Fibonacci The Man

His real name was Leonardo Pisano Bogollo, and he lived between 1170 and 1250 in Italy."Fibonacci" was his nickname, which roughly means "Son of Bonacci".
As well as being famous for the Fibonacci Sequence, he helped spread Hindu-Arabic Numerals 
(like our present numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) through Europe in place of Roman Numerals (I, II, III, IV, V, etc). 
That has saved us all a lot of trouble! Thank you Leonardo.

* Using ‘for’ loop
* Using ‘while’ loop

For this application, `<for>` loop is utilised.
